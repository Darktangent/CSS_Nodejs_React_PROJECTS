//1. Make the above code have a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. Use Function Declaration to create this function.

//2. Create another function that does the same thing, called checkDriverAge2() using Function Expression.

//BONUS: Instead of using the prompt. Now, only use the return keyword and make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
//checkDriverAge(92);
//it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
